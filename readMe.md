# CureFest
by Hope Marie David

# project overview
“CureFest” is a ficticous-festival dedicated to raising awareness of the autoimmune disease, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. This festival would also be partnered with the Lupus Research Alliance, a leading nonprofit organization that is committed to advancing research and finding a cure for lupus. This event also serves as a fundraising event, with the funds being put towards the research being done to find a cure. The purpose of this website is to allow users to be informed about the event and buy tickets, as well as purchase merchandise with all of the proceeds going into funding Lupus research. It is also important to recognize that Lupus is a disease that appears in and mostly affects women, and this is where the butterfly motif throughout the website is most important. The butterfly is the symbol of Lupus, as one of the main characteristics of the disease is a malar rash, which is a butterfly-shaped that spans the cheeks, nose, and forehead of the individual who has the disease. Butterflies are also a symbol that is linked to the perception of femininity that captures the essence of grace and elegance. In various cultures, the butterflies are also connected to the idea of the soul and are considered symbols of endurance and resilience. These are qualities that are often associated with women who navigate challenges and overcome obstacles. In addition to butterflies, purple is also a main color that is used throughout the website as it is the designated color for Lupus awareness. 
“CureFest” would be taking place from May 8th through May 10th, with the last day being World Lupus Day. This ficticous festival would be located at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, CA. I feel that this park would be an optimal place to hold this event, as it has a great amount of area that can be utilized well. Golden Gate Park is the place that holds the annual Walk to End Lupus Now, which is the only one of its kind in the SF Bay Area. 
As an individual who has had multiple loved ones lose their battle with Lupus, I feel that this festival would be a great way for me to amplify my voice in finding a cure through influential modes of communication like music and art, as well as incorporating artists that have experience and familiarity with the disease. 

# technical overview

The website consists of four pages that utilizes HTML and CSS. The three pages are: the home page ("home"), a page highlighting the festival's events ("events"), a page for merchandise and the purchasing of tickets ("shop"), and an about page that consists of the festival's mission and information about our partner, the Lupus Research Alliance ("about").

The "CureFest" name, logo, and overall branding materials were all made in Adobe Illustrator. The wireframing for this website was done in Figma.
